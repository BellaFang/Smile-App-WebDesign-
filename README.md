# Smile-App-WebDesign-
Smile is an app to share experiences from your day that made you smile and things people did that you are grateful for. It's inspired by the Gratitude Journal. Psychologists did a series of research experiments where they had individuals write down three things they are grateful for each day, and it significantly boosted their happiness. But instead of keeping a super secret personal journal, why not spread happiness? Users can read the "smile" messages others have posted, or post their own.
